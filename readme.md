You have to run runAllRunsSpectra.sh to get the current count. 
To do the extrapolation run doExtrapolation.C
You can add more triggers to the list by adding to this file: 
input/keepTriggersSpectraList.txt

when more runs appear you have to add them to runAllRunsSpectra.sh and also in getFiresRun.sh
